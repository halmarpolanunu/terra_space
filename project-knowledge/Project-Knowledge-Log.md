# Project Knowledge Log

## 2026-07-13 — Docker Compose runtime verified

- Added the local two-service Docker Compose runtime and PowerShell start/stop helpers.
- The frontend binds only to `127.0.0.1:3000`; the backend database remains private inside the Docker network while its `data/` storage is mounted from the host.
- Confirmed that SQLite data remains available after container restart.

## 2026-07-13 — Phase 1 navigation and offline-map foundation implemented

- Added the neutral five-page navigation shell and LM Studio service-status reporting.
- Added a reproducible, fully offline low-detail world-map package workflow using local PMTiles.

## 2026-07-13 — Phase 1 storage foundation implemented

- Implemented the initial local storage and SQLite foundation on the `phase-1-foundation` branch.
- Added safe data-directory initialization, offline-aware health status, and a reversible migration for core Terra Space records.

## 2026-07-13 — Phase 1 implementation plan prepared

- Approved the Phase 1 foundation design and prepared the detailed implementation plan.
- Kept the dedicated visual-design session as a required checkpoint before final styling.

## 2026-07-13 — Phase 1 foundation direction selected

- Repository inspection confirmed that application implementation has not started.
- Selected Docker Compose, Next.js, FastAPI, SQLite, and local file storage for the MVP foundation.
- Selected a fully offline, replaceable low-detail world PMTiles map package.
- Confirmed an English interface and a separate visual-design session before final styling.

Add new entries at the top only for meaningful changes to direction, roadmap, decisions, or the project's continuation point. Do not log spelling fixes or minor formatting changes.

## 2026-07-13 - MVP brief ingested

- Ingested the Terra Space MVP brief into the North Star, Roadmap, Current Status, and Decisions.
- Defined Terra Space as a local-first single-user intelligence workspace.
- Set MVP scope around manual documents, batch LM Studio processing, event review, deduplication recommendation, approved Events, Dashboard, and Settings.
- Recorded the local-first MVP architecture decision.

## 2026-07-13 - Installed for terra_space

- Installed the lean Project Knowledge setup into the `terra_space` project root.
- Set the current continuation point: define the real North Star before major implementation.
- Preserved the token-saving structure: North Star, Current Status, Roadmap, Knowledge Log, and Decisions.

## 2026-07-13 - Lean Project Knowledge

- Replaced separate capability, use-case, and milestone structures with one phase-based Roadmap.
- Simplified the shared agent workflow and onboarding documents.
- Updated validation for the lean knowledge structure.

## Template initialization

- Created the connected OKF knowledge structure and AI-agent instruction adapters.
- Replace this entry with the first project-specific knowledge update after cloning.
